# Dependency Update Plan

## Current State
After analyzing the current dependencies, we found:
- Most packages are outdated
- Several security vulnerabilities exist
- Some major libraries (like Electron) need significant version updates

## Safe Updates (Recommended for first phase)
These updates can be done with minimal risk:

```bash
# Update these dependencies to their "wanted" versions
npm update
```

This has already been completed and updated:
- @fortawesome/fontawesome-free: 5.12.0 → 5.15.4
- chroma-js: 2.1.0 → 2.6.0
- dotenv: 8.2.0 → 8.6.0
- jquery: 3.5.0 → 3.7.1
- node-schedule: 1.3.2 → 1.3.3
- sweetalert2: 9.5.4 → 9.17.4
- telegraf: 3.35.0 → 3.40.0
- winston: 3.2.1 → 3.17.0

## Breaking Updates (Require testing)
These updates should be handled carefully:

1. **Electron (13.6.9 → 35.1.4)**
   - Major change with security implications
   - Will require adjustments to the codebase
   - Renderer API changes may impact functionality

2. **image-downloader (3.6.0 → 4.3.0)**
   - Uses deprecated 'request' package
   - Consider replacing with a newer alternative

3. **telegraf (3.40.0 → 4.16.3)**
   - API changes between v3 and v4
   - Will require code adjustments

4. **sweetalert2 (9.17.4 → 11.17.2)**
   - API changes may impact UI

## Security Vulnerabilities
The following security issues remain after the safe updates:

1. Electron: Multiple high-severity issues
2. got: Moderate severity issue (via @electron/get)
3. request: Moderate severity issue (via image-downloader)
4. tough-cookie: Moderate severity issue
5. sweetalert2: Low severity issue

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Test the application with the current updates
2. Create separate branches for each major dependency update
3. Update Electron with highest priority (security concerns)
4. Consider alternatives to deprecated packages (e.g., 'request')
5. Update remaining packages with breaking changes
6. Run comprehensive tests after each update

## Commands for Breaking Updates
```bash
# Update Electron (BREAKING CHANGE)
npm install electron@latest

# Update sweetalert2
npm install sweetalert2@latest

# Update telegraf (BREAKING CHANGE)
npm install telegraf@latest

# Replace image-downloader with a modern alternative
# (Research needed)
```
